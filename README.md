# Tic Tac Toe in Go

TicTacToe is my first public project in Go with *TDD*.

I refactored this project a couple of times to get any possible experience with GO.

I am open to any feedback you would like to give me.

## Test

`go test`

## How to play

For now, I will user this game package in [Bash](https://github.com/lelledaniele/gotictactoe-bash)
